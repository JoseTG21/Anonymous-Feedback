# Anonymous-Feedback
Anonymous feedback project 
# Anonymous Feedback Board

A simple full-stack web application built with Next.js and Supabase to collect anonymous (or named) feedback in real-time.  
Users can submit feedback messages, optionally provide their name or remain anonymous, and view recent feedback from others.
